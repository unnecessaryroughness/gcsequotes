    welcome: "Welcome to GCSE Quotes. <break time='1s'/> I will ask you a series of questions about quotes from GCSE texts. After each question I will pause and wait for you to tell me the full quote. If you get it right, you get a point, and I will ask you another question. When you have had enough, just tell me to stop. <break time='1s'/> "
